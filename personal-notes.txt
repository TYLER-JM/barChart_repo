  - figure out how to reorder the options parameter

july 17
  -a new createScale() must include something to prepend yAxis to,
  as well as the element that the chart is attached to
  -it will also include an argument which will be newArrayOfValues[i] so that it can be looped in the same way createBar is
  -newArrayOfValues[i] itself will be an array of three values
    •marker position
    •marker-value position
    •marker-value...value 

  createScale(elems, arr)
