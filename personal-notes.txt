  - figure out how to reorder the options parameter

july 17
  -a new createScale() must include something to prepend yAxis to,
  as well as the element that the chart is attached to
  -it will also include an argument which will be newArrayOfValues[i] so that it can be looped in the same way createBar is
  -newArrayOfValues[i] itself will be an array of three values
    •marker position
    •marker-value position
    •marker-value...value 

  createScale(elems, arr)

    -reorganizing options array into an object:
    OLD: three objects within an array

    [
      {start: 0, end: 35, increment: 5},
      {
        title: "Items Purchased",
        yTitle: "amount",
        xTitle: "season",
        rotate: false
      },
      {
        barColor: [
          ["pants", "blue"],
          ["shorts", "red"],
          ["coats", "gray"]
        ],
        xValuePos: "center",
        padding: "20px"
      }
    ]

    NEW:
    {
      scale: [0, 35, 5],
      width: "500px",
      height: "400px",
      mainTitle: ["the Title", "12px", "blue"],
      xTitle: ["the Title", "12px", "blue"],
      yTitle: ["the Title", "12px", "blue"],
      positionValues: "start", //(replaces xValuePos)
      labelColor: "red", //color of labels along x yAxis
      barColor: "rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.5)"
      padding: "15px";
    }

    stacked values barColor: [
                              ["pants", "blue"],
                              ["shorts", "red"],
                              ["coats", "gray"]                        
                             ]

MUST CHANGE within function:
  -title-making section refers to options[1]

  -calling getScale() refers to options[0]
  -calling createBar() refers to options[2]

  -conditional rotation statement refers to options[1]

  -conditional legend statement refers to options[2]

MUST ADD within function:
  -cutomize titles' size and color
  -customize chart height/width
  -labels' color (along x axis)

  -BARCOLOR RETHINK! each bar should be its own color
    -barColor should take an array either way
    -one value per bar

      barColor: ["red", "blue", "green", "gray"]

    -will need to update conditional statement in createBar()
  

    -in invocation of createBar(dataArr, visArr)
    must change: options.barColor  => options.barColor[i]
        -legend conditional: if (typeof options.barColor[0] === "object")
        -conditional statement within createBar(): if (typeof visArr[0] === "object")
    -in all cases barColor[i] will be an array
    -in SOME cases barColor[i] will be a 2D array, 
    check with: if (typeof dataArr[1][0] === "object")

  Looks like... 
  createBar() should be divided into at least two smaller functions
  -one to create a stacked bar, one to create a bar with a single value.
  -b/c a stack will need all of the sub-arrays inside barColor,
   but a single value bar will only need barColor[i]
  -invocation would be something like...

for (data.length)
  if (typeof data[i].value === "object") {
    createStack()
  } else {
    createBar()
  }
